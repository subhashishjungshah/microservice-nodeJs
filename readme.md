## Introduction

This project aims to demonstrate the development of an online grocery store using microservices. Microservices are small, independent services that work together to form a complete application. Each microservice is responsible for a specific business capability, allowing for flexibility, scalability, and easier maintenance compared to monolithic architectures.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Allow users to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.
- **Product Catalog**: Display a variety of grocery items with details and pricing.
- **Shopping Cart**: Enable users to add, remove, and purchase items.
- **Order Management**: Track and manage orders placed by users.
- **Payment Processing**: Integrate payment gateways for secure transactions.
- **Inventory Management**: Update stock levels and manage product availability.
- **Microservices Communication**: Demonstrate communication among microservices using APIs.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: JavaScript.
- **Backend Frameworks**: Node.js, Express.js.
- **Database**: MongoDB, PostgreSQL.
- **Message Brokers**: RabbitMQ, Kafka, etc.
- **Containerization**: Docker.
- **API Gateway**: Kong, Zuul, etc.
- **Deployment**: AWS.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies for each microservice using package managers like npm or pip.
4. Set up environment variables and configuration files as necessary.
5. Run `docker-compose up` to start the microservices and their dependencies.

## Architecture Overview

The architecture follows a microservices-based approach, utilizing a combination of backend technologies, databases, and communication protocols. The system is designed to be scalable, fault-tolerant, and modular.
